# Static-Routing-Configuration-CCNA
CCNA Static Routing Lab using Cisco Packet Tracer. Includes step-by-step configuration, ping tests, and network topology

## Objective
- Learn and implement static routing across multiple routers.
- Verify connectivity using ping and troubleshooting techniques.

## Tools
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Microsoft Word (documentation)
- Screenshots / Images for topology and ping tests

## Commands Used
- ip route [network] [mask] [next-hop]
- show ip route
- ping

## Testing & Verification
- Ping tests between routers to confirm connectivity.
- Show ip route output confirms correct static routing.

## Files
- Static_Routing_Lab.pkt → Packet Tracer file
- Lab_Documentation.pdf → Step-by-step guide
- Screenshots/ → Ping test results, router configurations

## Observations / Challenges
- Initial ping failures due to misconfigured next-hop IPs.
- Corrected routes resolved connectivity issues.
- Learned troubleshooting and verification for multi-router topology.

## Documentation
- The complete step-by-step configuration and observations are available in the PDF below:
